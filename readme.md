> Learn more about Advent of Code (AOC) at https://adventofcode.com/. Find support at (r/AdventOfCode)[https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/s/mzBYFFEL8C].

## Structure

* Directory for each year of solutions (named YYYY, e.g., `2025`)
  * Sub-directory for data (named `data`).  The solution expects the data files to be name dXpx.txt (e.g., `d1p1.txt` for the data related to the first challenge on day 1).
  * Individual files for each day (e.g., `day1.txt`).
* Directory for the test suite named `test`.
  * A master script named `test.js`. 
  * Individual files for each years tests named `test_yyyy.js` (e.g., `test_2025.js`)
  
## Running Solution

Execute `npm run test` to run the test suite. Note that my private AOC test data is excluded from this repository and that the test cases expect results based on that test data. **You'll need to provide your test data and update the expected results inside the test suite.**
